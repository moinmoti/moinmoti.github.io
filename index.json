However, the existing literature deals only with citizen's with positive valuation and symmetric belief towards the project's provision.  In this work, we present novel mechanisms which break these two barriers, i.e., mechanisms which incorporate negative valuation and asymmetric belief, independently. For negative valuation, we present a methodology for converting existing mechanisms to mechanisms that incorporate agents with negative valuations. Particularly, we adapt existing PPR and PPS mechanisms, to present novel PPRN and PPSN mechanisms which incentivize strategic agents to contribute to the project based on their true preference. With respect to asymmetric belief, we propose a reward scheme Belief Based Reward (BBR) based on Robust Bayesian Truth Serum mechanism. With BBR, we propose a general mechanism for civic crowdfunding which incorporates asymmetric agents. We leverage PPR and PPS, to present PPRx and PPSx. We prove that in PPRx and PPSx, agents with greater belief towards the project's provision contribute more than agents with lesser belief. Further, we also show that contributions are such that the project is provisioned at equilibrium.\n","tags":["IJCAI","Noncooperative Games","Auctions","Game Theory","Crowdfunding","Mechanism Design"],"title":"Civic Crowdfunding for Agents with Negative Valuations and Agents with Asymmetric Beliefs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Moin Hussain Moti","Dimitris Chatzopoulos","Pan Hui","Sujar Gujar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565779381,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565779381,"objectID":"237910f0821113481ba9ca3cd7af333d","permalink":"/publication/farm/","publishdate":"2019-08-14T16:13:01+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/farm/","section":"publication","summary":"Although peer prediction markets are widely used in crowdsourcing to aggregate information from agents, they often fail to reward the participating agents equitably. Honest agents can be wrongly penalized if randomly paired with dishonest ones. In this work, we introduce selective and cumulative fairness. We characterize a mechanism as fair if it satisfies both notions and present FaRM, a representative mechanism we designed. FaRM is a Nash incentive mechanism that focuses on information aggregation for spontaneous local activities which are accessible to a limited number of agents without assuming any prior knowledge of the event. All the agents in the vicinity observe the same information. FaRM uses (i) a report strength score to remove the risk of random pairing with dishonest reporters, (ii) a consistency score to measure an agent's history of accurate reports and distinguish valuable reports, (iii) a reliability score to estimate the probability of an agent to collude with nearby agents and prevents agents from getting swayed, and (iv) a location robustness score to filter agents who try to participate without being present in the considered setting. Together, report strength, consistency, and reliability represent a fair reward given to agents based on their reports.\n","tags":["IJCAI","Crowdsensing","Game Theory","Mechanism Design","Reputations Scores"],"title":"FaRM: Fair Reward Mechanism for Information Aggregating in Spontaneous Localized Settings","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552852803,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552852803,"objectID":"881012d3adc7c0c80e043e60ae56fcf6","permalink":"/project/block-hole/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T01:30:03+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/block-hole/","section":"project","summary":"A 3D game similar to BLOXORG with multiple levels and soundtrack","tags":["python"],"title":"Block in the Hole","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552852700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552852700,"objectID":"6fd57da43583c607a0ddf091caf8952d","permalink":"/project/gift-hunt/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T01:28:20+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/gift-hunt/","section":"project","summary":"A short animated movie based on an interaction between father and son","tags":["unity","animation"],"title":"Gift Hunt","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552852633,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552852633,"objectID":"016638c578e67f601c9dd938f8639925","permalink":"/project/proxy-server/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T01:27:13+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/proxy-server/","section":"project","summary":"An internet proxy server with user authentication and caching","tags":["python","computer-networks"],"title":"Proxy Server","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552852537,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552852537,"objectID":"f5e7d681a35f6fa8bb996beb75fa68de","permalink":"/project/clash/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T01:25:37+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/clash/","section":"project","summary":"An interactive and customized Bash-like shell implemented in C.","tags":["operating-systems","bash"],"title":"Clash","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552852210,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552852210,"objectID":"86e184b4480e9b190d29153c1c698dcd","permalink":"/project/correlated-equilibria-finder/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T01:20:10+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/correlated-equilibria-finder/","section":"project","summary":"A python based programme for finding multiple correlated equilibria in a NFG format defined game","tags":["game-theory","python"],"title":"Correlated Equilibria Finder","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552851434,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552851434,"objectID":"9665b1c9a6342cd2f3279e7bbc3c26fa","permalink":"/project/ultimate_tictactoe/","publishdate":"2019-03-18T01:07:14+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/ultimate_tictactoe/","section":"project","summary":"A 4x4x4 tic-tac-toe bot made by using Minimax alpha beta pruning","tags":["artificial-intelligence","python"],"title":"Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sankarshan Damle","Moin Hussain Moti","Praphul Chandra","Sujar Gujar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548181800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548181800,"objectID":"e8d2b8e6108a2af27d1b7cbf6f4edcd5","permalink":"/publication/ppsn_aamas/","publishdate":"2019-01-23T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/ppsn_aamas/","section":"publication","summary":"We focus on the aggregation of citizen preferences for public projects through civic crowdfunding. Existing civic crowdfunding mechanisms consider only agents with positive valuation towards the public project. Moreover, these mechanisms assume that each agent has a symmetric belief about the project getting provisioned. As public projects aim to cater to the majority, they should be provisioned only if the majority prefers it. To incorporate negative valuations, we propose a methodology to convert existing civic crowdfunding mechanisms for positive preferences to cater to markets having both types of agents. Specifically, we adapt existing PPR and PPS mechanisms to design PPRN and PPSN, that incentivize agents to contribute towards or against the project's provision: based on their preference. Besides, to address asymmetric beliefs, we propose a novel reward scheme,  Belief Based Reward (BBR) based on Robust Bayesian Truth Serum (RBTS) mechanism. BBR rewards agents based on their belief towards the project's provision. Using this reward scheme, we introduce a general mechanism for civic crowdfunding which allows for agents having asymmetric beliefs towards the project getting provisioned and incentivizes them to contribute towards the project's provision. We illustrate the general mechanism by designing two novel mechanisms, namely PPRx and PPSx, adapting PPR and PPS respectively, and prove that in both the mechanisms the project is provisioned at equilibrium.\n","tags":["IJCAI","Noncooperative Games","Auctions","Game Theory","Crowdfunding","Mechanism Design"],"title":"Aggregating Citizen Preferences for Public Projects Through Civic Crowdfunding","type":"publication"}]
