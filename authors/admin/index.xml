      <description>I am pursuing my research in the field of Information Markets and Blockchains. My work involves analysing the game theoretic aspects of these frameworks and based on that designing mechanisms which are at least as efficient as current mechanisms and preserve privacy of the user. In a gist, the aim is to leverage the decentralization and privacy preserving properties of blockchains in the field of Information Markets.</description>
